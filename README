This little software was made for school.

The goal was to learn how to make an anaglyph 3D renderer with primitive rasterization.
We must thanks Dimitry Sokolov for his courses which can be find here :

Compiling : make

Executing : ./render [ObjectFile.obj]

If no object file is specified, the software use diablo3_pose by default.
If you want to read a paired diffuse file, put it in the same folder than the object file.

This software do :

- Triangle rasterization
- Texture
- Gouraud shading
- anaglyph
